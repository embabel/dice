You are translating a natural language question into a Prolog query.

Question: "{{ question }}"

Available predicates (each takes 2 arguments):
{% for pred in predicates %}
- {{ pred }}(X, Y)
{% endfor %}

Sample facts from the knowledge base:
{% for fact in sampleFacts %}
{{ fact }}
{% endfor %}

Generate a Prolog query to answer this question. The query should:
1. Use only the available predicates listed above
2. Use uppercase variable names (X, Y, Person, Topic, etc.)
3. Be a valid Prolog goal (no trailing period)

If the question cannot be answered with the available predicates, set prologQuery to null.

Examples:
- "Who is an expert in Kubernetes?" -> expert_in(X, 'kubernetes')
- "What does Alice know?" -> expert_in('alice', Topic)
- "Who are friends with Bob?" -> friend_of(X, 'bob')
- "Where does Alice work?" -> works_at('alice', Company)

Respond with JSON:
{
  "prologQuery": "the_query(X, Y)" or null,
  "resultVariables": ["X", "Y"],
  "negativeAnswer": "No, [appropriate negative response]",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}
