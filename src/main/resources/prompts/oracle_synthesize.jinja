You are answering a question based on relevant propositions (facts).

Question: "{{ question }}"

Relevant propositions:
{% for prop in propositions %}
- {{ prop }}
{% endfor %}

Synthesize a natural language answer that:
1. Directly answers the question using information from the propositions
2. Only includes information that is supported by the propositions
3. Acknowledges if the answer is partial or uncertain

If the propositions don't contain enough information to answer the question,
say so clearly.
