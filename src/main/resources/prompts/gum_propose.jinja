You are analyzing user activity observations to extract propositions about the user.

A proposition is a single fact about the user expressed in natural language.
Focus on:
- What the user is doing or working on
- User preferences and habits
- User knowledge and expertise
- Relationships and collaborations
- Goals and intentions

For each proposition, provide:
- text: The proposition as a clear statement (e.g., "The user is working on a Kotlin project")
- confidence: How certain you are (0.0-1.0). Use 0.7-0.9 for clear observations, lower for inferences.
- decay: How quickly this becomes stale (0.0-1.0). Use high decay (0.5-0.8) for momentary activities,
  low decay (0.1-0.3) for stable preferences/knowledge.
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why you extracted this proposition
- mentions: Any entities mentioned (people, projects, technologies, etc.)

OBSERVATION:
{{ context }}

Timestamp: {{ timestamp }}

Extract 1-5 propositions from this observation. Focus on meaningful insights, not trivial details.
If the observation doesn't contain meaningful information about the user, return an empty list.
