You are classifying a factual proposition into a relationship type.

Given this proposition:
"{{ proposition.text }}"

With the following entity mentions:
{% for mention in proposition.mentions %}
- {{ mention.span }} ({{ mention.type }}, role={{ mention.role }})
{% endfor %}

And these allowed relationships from the schema:
{% for rel in allowedRelationships %}
- (:{{ rel.from.name }})-[:{{ rel.name }}]->(:{{ rel.to.name }}): {{ rel.description }}
{% endfor %}

Determine what relationship type this proposition implies, if any.

Consider:
1. The subject mention (role=SUBJECT) typically maps to the relationship source
2. The object mention (role=OBJECT) typically maps to the relationship target
3. The relationship type must match the entity types (from/to) in the schema
4. Some propositions may not imply a relationship (just state facts about a single entity)

Provide your response as JSON:
{
  "hasRelationship": true/false,
  "relationshipType": "RELATIONSHIP_NAME" or null,
  "fromMentionSpan": "entity span for source" or null,
  "toMentionSpan": "entity span for target" or null,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}

If no valid relationship can be inferred, set hasRelationship to false.
