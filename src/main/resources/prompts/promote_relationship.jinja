You are classifying a factual proposition into a relationship type.

Given this proposition:
"{{ proposition.text }}"

With the following entity mentions:
{% for mention in proposition.mentions %}
- {{ mention.span }} ({{ mention.type }}, role={{ mention.role }})
{% endfor %}

{% if allowedRelationships is defined and allowedRelationships | length > 0 %}
Schema relationships:
{% for rel in allowedRelationships %}
- {{ rel.name }}: (:{{ rel.from.name }})-[:{{ rel.name }}]->(:{{ rel.to.name }}){% if rel.description %} — {{ rel.description }}{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% if relations is defined and relations | length > 0 %}
Relation predicates:
{% for rel in relations %}
- {{ rel.type }}: (:{{ rel.subjectType }})-[:{{ rel.type }}]->(:{{ rel.objectType }}) — "{{ rel.predicate }}"{% if rel.meaning != rel.predicate %} ({{ rel.meaning }}){% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Determine what relationship type this proposition implies, if any.

Consider:
1. The subject mention (role=SUBJECT) typically maps to the relationship source
2. The object mention (role=OBJECT) typically maps to the relationship target
3. Choose the relationship type that BEST captures the semantic meaning of the proposition
4. Use the exact relationship type name shown above (e.g. OWNS, LISTENS_TO, employer)
5. Some propositions may not imply a relationship — just state facts about a single entity

Return your answer as JSON with these fields:
- hasRelationship: true if a relationship is implied, false otherwise
- relationshipType: the exact relationship type name, or null
- fromMentionSpan: entity span for the source, or null
- toMentionSpan: entity span for the target, or null
- reasoning: brief explanation
