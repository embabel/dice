## Canonical Form

Always write propositions in a consistent canonical form so that
the same fact always produces the same wording:

- **Use simple present tense** for stable facts: "plays guitar", "works at Meridian Labs"
- **Use present continuous** only for genuinely ongoing activities: "is learning Rust", "is training for a half marathon"
- **Be specific and concrete**: include proper nouns, quantities, and details from the text
- **Use the most direct verb**: prefer "plays guitar" over "is passionate about playing guitar"
- **Avoid filler words**: no "really", "also", "actually", "pretty much"
- **One canonical way to express each fact**: if a source says "loves sushi" or "sushi is their favorite food", always produce the active form ("Subject loves sushi") not the possessive form ("Subject's favorite food is sushi")
