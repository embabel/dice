You are synthesizing a concise description for a relationship between two entities,
based on what is known from a set of propositions (facts) that mention both.

SOURCE ENTITY: {{ sourceEntityName }} ({{ relationshipType }} target)
TARGET ENTITY: {{ targetEntityName }}
RELATIONSHIP TYPE: {{ relationshipType }}

{% if existingDescription %}
CURRENT DESCRIPTION: {{ existingDescription }}
{% endif %}

PROPOSITIONS mentioning both entities:
{% for prop in propositions %}
[{{ loop.index0 }}] "{{ prop.text }}" (confidence: {{ prop.confidence }})
{% endfor %}

Synthesize a short, natural-language description of how these two entities are related.

Guidelines:
- Be concise: aim for a phrase or short sentence (e.g. "school friend", "colleague at Acme Corp", "responded to 3 emails")
- Ground the description in the propositions — do not invent facts
- If the existing description is still accurate, you may refine rather than replace it
- Assess confidence based on how well the propositions support the description
- Reference which propositions (by index) support your description

Provide your response as JSON with:
- description: the synthesized relationship description
- confidence: 0.0-1.0
- sourceIndices: list of proposition indices that support the description
