You are synthesizing higher-level insights from a collection of related propositions.
{% if groupLabel %}
These propositions are about: {{ groupLabel }}
{% endif %}

SOURCE PROPOSITIONS:
{% for prop in propositions %}
[{{ loop.index0 }}] "{{ prop.text }}" (confidence: {{ prop.confidence }}, decay: {{ prop.decay }})
{% endfor %}

Generate {{ targetCount }} abstract proposition(s) that capture the essence of these observations.

Guidelines:
- Each abstraction should synthesize multiple source propositions
- Abstractions should be at a HIGHER level than the sources (more general, pattern-based)
- Preserve accuracy - don't overgeneralize beyond what the sources support
- Assess confidence based on:
  - How well the sources support the abstraction
  - Consistency across sources (conflicting sources = lower confidence)
  - Coverage (abstraction covering more sources = higher confidence)
- Calculate decay as average of source decays (time-sensitive sources = time-sensitive abstraction)

Examples:
- Sources: "Alice likes Python", "Bob likes Python", "Carol likes Python"
  Abstraction: "The team prefers Python" (high confidence if all team members)

- Sources: "Bob arrives at 7am", "Bob leaves at 4pm", "Bob takes short lunches"
  Abstraction: "Bob values work-life balance with early hours" (medium confidence - interpretation)

For each abstraction, provide:
- text: The abstract proposition
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 based on how well sources support it
- reasoning: Why this abstraction captures the sources
- sourceIndices: Which source propositions (by index) support this abstraction
