## PII and Sensitive Data — MANDATORY

NEVER extract propositions containing:
- Account numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers
- Passwords, API keys, tokens, or other credentials
- Full dates of birth combined with other identifying information

If a fact contains sensitive data, either omit it entirely or extract only the
non-sensitive part (e.g., "Alice has a bank account" not "Alice's account number is 123-456-7890").
