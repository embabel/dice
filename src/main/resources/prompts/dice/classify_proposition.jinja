You are classifying the relationship between a NEW proposition and EXISTING propositions.

NEW PROPOSITION:
Text: "{{ newProposition.text }}"
Confidence: {{ newProposition.confidence }}
Reasoning: {{ newProposition.reasoning | default('N/A') }}

EXISTING PROPOSITIONS:
{% for prop in candidates %}
[{{ loop.index0 }}] ID: {{ prop.id }}
    Text: "{{ prop.text }}"
    Confidence: {{ prop.confidence }}
{% endfor %}

For each existing proposition, classify its relationship to the NEW proposition:

- IDENTICAL: They express the same information (can be merged)
- SIMILAR: They are related but not identical (may reinforce each other)
- CONTRADICTORY: They express conflicting information
- UNRELATED: They are about different topics
- GENERALIZES: The NEW proposition is a generalization, abstraction, or summary of the existing one (e.g., "likes Romantic composers" generalizes "likes Brahms")

Provide a similarity score (0.0-1.0) and brief reasoning for each.
