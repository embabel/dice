You are classifying the relationship between a NEW proposition and EXISTING propositions.

NEW PROPOSITION:
Text: "{{ newProposition.text }}"
Confidence: {{ newProposition.confidence }}
Reasoning: {{ newProposition.reasoning | default('N/A') }}

EXISTING PROPOSITIONS:
{% for prop in candidates %}
[{{ loop.index0 }}] ID: {{ prop.id }}
    Text: "{{ prop.text }}"
    Confidence: {{ prop.confidence }}
{% endfor %}

For each existing proposition, classify its relationship to the NEW proposition:

- IDENTICAL: They express the EXACT same fact, just worded differently (can be merged)
- SIMILAR: They express the same core fact about the same specific entity/topic (not just thematically related)
  Examples of SIMILAR: "Alice likes Bach" ↔ "Alice enjoys Bach's music" (same person, same composer)
  Examples of NOT SIMILAR: "Alice likes Bach" ↔ "Alice likes Mozart" (different composers = UNRELATED)
- CONTRADICTORY: They express directly conflicting information about the same fact
- UNRELATED: They are about different specific topics, entities, or facts (even if thematically related)
  Note: Liking different composers are UNRELATED facts, not SIMILAR
  Note: Preferences about a time period vs specific composer are UNRELATED
- GENERALIZES: The NEW proposition directly summarizes or abstracts the existing one (e.g., "likes Romantic composers" generalizes "likes Brahms")

Be STRICT: When in doubt, classify as UNRELATED. Only use SIMILAR for propositions about the SAME specific entity.

Provide a similarity score (0.0-1.0) and brief reasoning for each.
