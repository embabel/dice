You are identifying differences between two groups of propositions.

GROUP A: {{ labelA }}
{% for prop in groupA %}
[A{{ loop.index0 }}] "{{ prop.text }}" (confidence: {{ prop.confidence }})
{% endfor %}

GROUP B: {{ labelB }}
{% for prop in groupB %}
[B{{ loop.index0 }}] "{{ prop.text }}" (confidence: {{ prop.confidence }})
{% endfor %}

Generate {{ targetCount }} contrast proposition(s) that articulate meaningful differences between these groups.

Guidelines:
- Focus on DIFFERENCES - what distinguishes {{ labelA }} from {{ labelB }}
- Each contrast should compare related aspects (e.g., both about preferences, both about work style)
- Be specific: "{{ labelA }} prefers X while {{ labelB }} prefers Y" not just "they are different"
- Only contrast when there's actual comparable information in both groups
- Assess confidence based on:
  - Clarity of the difference (explicit contradiction = high confidence)
  - Relevance of comparison (comparing apples to apples)
  - Strength of source propositions

Examples of good contrasts:
- "Alice prefers morning meetings while Bob prefers afternoon meetings"
- "Alice and Bob have opposite approaches to documentation - detailed vs minimal"
- "Unlike Alice who works remotely, Bob prefers working in the office"

Examples of poor contrasts (avoid):
- "Alice and Bob are different" (too vague)
- "Alice likes Python" (not a contrast, just about one group)
- "Alice prefers Python while Bob had lunch at noon" (unrelated aspects)

For each contrast, provide:
- text: The contrast proposition comparing the two groups
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 based on how clear and supported the difference is
- reasoning: Why this is a meaningful difference
- sourceIndicesA: Which propositions from group A (by index) support this
- sourceIndicesB: Which propositions from group B (by index) support this
