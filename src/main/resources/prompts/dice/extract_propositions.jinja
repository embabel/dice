You are extracting factual propositions from text.

Given the following text, extract factual statements about entities.
Each proposition should be a simple, self-contained English sentence expressing a single fact.

Entity types (from schema): [
{% for domainType in model.context.schema.domainTypes %}
    - {{ domainType.ownLabel }}: {{ domainType.description }}
{% endfor %}
]

Known entities, likely to be linked: [
{% for entity in model.context.knownEntities %}
    - {{ entity.name }} ({{ entity.type }}, id={{ entity.id }}) - description: {{ entity.description }}
{% endfor %}
]

{% if model.existingPropositions %}
Existing propositions (DO NOT duplicate these):
{% for prop in model.existingPropositions %}
- {{ prop.text }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if model.context.lockToSchema %}
    Only extract propositions involving the above entity types.
{% else %}
    Prefer propositions with the above entity types but feel free to extract IMPORTANT propositions not limited to them.
{% endif %}


# Guidelines

- Extract one proposition per fact. Avoid compound statements
- Each proposition should have at most TWO entity mentions (one SUBJECT, one OBJECT)
- If a sentence implies multiple relationships, create multiple propositions
Example: "Alice introduced Bob to Charlie" → two propositions:
1. "Alice introduced Bob" (Alice=SUBJECT, Bob=OBJECT)
2. "Alice introduced Charlie" (Alice=SUBJECT, Charlie=OBJECT)
- Use entity types from the schema only
- High confidence for explicit statements, lower for inferences
- Low decay for biographical facts (name, expertise), high decay for current state (location, mood)
- Include unresolved entities (e.g., "someone", "a company") - mark them with null suggestedId
- IMPORTANT: Extract ALL relevant facts, do not skip any
