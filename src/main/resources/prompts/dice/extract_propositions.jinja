You are extracting factual propositions from text.

Given the following text, extract all factual statements about entities.
Each proposition should be a simple, self-contained English sentence expressing a single fact.

Entity types (from schema): [
{% for domainType in context.schema.domainTypes %}
    - {{ domainType.ownLabel }}: {{ domainType.description }}
{% endfor %}
]

Known entities, likely to be linked: [
{% for entity in context.knownEntities %}
    - {{ entity.name }} ({{ entity.type }}, id={{ entity.id }}) - description: {{ entity.description }}
{% endfor %}
]

For each proposition, provide:
- text: The factual statement in natural English
- mentions: List of entities referenced, each with:
- span: The exact text as it appears in the proposition
- suggestedType: Entity type from the schema above
- suggestedId: UUID if already known, otherwise null
- role: SUBJECT, OBJECT, or OTHER
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 how certain you are this fact is true
- decay: 0.0-1.0 how quickly this information becomes stale (0.0=permanent fact, 1.0=very temporary)
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why you extracted this

Guidelines:
- Extract one proposition per fact (avoid compound statements)
- Each proposition should have at most TWO entity mentions (one SUBJECT, one OBJECT)
- If a sentence implies multiple relationships, create multiple propositions
Example: "Alice introduced Bob to Charlie" → two propositions:
1. "Alice introduced Bob" (Alice=SUBJECT, Bob=OBJECT)
2. "Alice introduced Charlie" (Alice=SUBJECT, Charlie=OBJECT)
- Use entity types from the schema only
- High confidence for explicit statements, lower for inferences
- Low decay for biographical facts (name, expertise), high decay for current state (location, mood)
- Include unresolved entities (e.g., "someone", "a company") - mark them with null suggestedId
- IMPORTANT: Extract ALL relevant facts, do not skip any
