You are extracting factual propositions from text.

Given the following text, extract factual statements about entities.
Each proposition should be a simple, self-contained English sentence expressing a single fact.

{% include "dice/schema_hints.jinja" %}

{% include "dice/existing_propositions.jinja" %}


# Guidelines

- Extract one proposition per fact. Avoid compound statements
- Each proposition should have at most TWO entity mentions (one SUBJECT, one OBJECT)
- If a sentence implies multiple relationships, create multiple propositions
Example: "Alice introduced Bob to Charlie" → two propositions:
1. "Alice introduced Bob" (Alice=SUBJECT, Bob=OBJECT)
2. "Alice introduced Charlie" (Alice=SUBJECT, Charlie=OBJECT)
- Use entity types from the schema only
- High confidence for explicit statements, lower for inferences
- Low decay for biographical facts (name, expertise), high decay for current state (location, mood)
- Include unresolved entities (e.g., "someone", "a company") - mark them with null suggestedId
- IMPORTANT: Extract ALL relevant facts, do not skip any
