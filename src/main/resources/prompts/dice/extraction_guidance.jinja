## Extraction Rules

1. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
2. **Schema-bound entities**: Prefer entity types from the schema above
3. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the text explicitly supports
4. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct
5. **Dense and specific**: Maximize signal-to-noise ratio. Avoid filler words, vague qualifiers, or restating context already captured in entity mentions. Prefer "Alice is a senior ML engineer at Google" over "Alice works at a company called Google where she is in a senior position doing machine learning engineering"

{% include "dice/canonical_form.jinja" %}

If a sentence implies multiple relationships, create multiple propositions.
Example: "Alice introduced Bob to Charlie" → two propositions:
1. "Alice introduced Bob" (Alice=SUBJECT, Bob=OBJECT)
2. "Alice introduced Charlie" (Alice=SUBJECT, Charlie=OBJECT)

## Entity Mentions - BE SPECIFIC

Entity mentions should be **specific, identifiable things** that could be looked up in a database.

✓ GOOD entity mentions (specific):
- "Alice Smith" - a specific person
- "Acme Corporation" - a specific company
- "Machine Learning" - a specific field/topic

✗ BAD entity mentions (too vague or generic):
- "recent projects" - vague, which projects? Just use this phrase in the proposition text
- "some colleagues" - vague, not specific entities
- "his expertise" - a quality, not an entity
- "the methodology" - abstract concept without specifics

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't point to ONE specific thing in a reference database, don't make it an entity mention. Include vague terms in the proposition text itself, not as entity mentions.

Example - text says "Alice loves her recent projects":
✓ GOOD: Proposition "Alice loves her recent projects" with entity mention "Alice" (Person) only
✗ BAD: Creating an entity mention for "recent projects"

Example - text says "Bob works at Google and Microsoft":
✓ GOOD: Two propositions with entity mentions "Google" (Company) and "Microsoft" (Company)

## Confidence, Importance & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit statements ("Alice is a software engineer")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied information (asking questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable facts (name, expertise, role)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current location, mood, current project)
- **Importance**: How much this fact matters to remember (independent of certainty)
- **High importance**: Health events, life changes, deadlines, strong preferences, safety-critical info
- **Medium importance**: Professional details, ongoing projects, relationships
- **Low importance**: Casual observations, small talk, routine activities
- Example: "Mary is about to have surgery" → importance: 1.0, even if confidence is moderate
- Example: "Alice mentioned the weather is nice" → importance: 0.2

When the text uses hedging language ("I think", "maybe", "probably", "not sure"), reflect this in confidence and explain in `reasoning`. Quote supporting evidence in `reasoning` when the fact is non-obvious.
- "I think Alice might work at Google" -> confidence: 0.4, reasoning: "Hedged — 'I think ... might' indicates uncertainty"
- "Alice is a senior engineer at Google" -> confidence: 0.95, reasoning: "Explicit factual statement"
