# This directory contains rendered Mermaid diagrams from README.md
# Generated by: ./scripts/render-diagrams.sh
#
# Diagrams are also inline in README.md as Mermaid code blocks,
# which GitHub renders natively. The PNG/SVG files here are for
# platforms that don't support Mermaid rendering.
#
# The .source-hash file tracks the hash of mermaid source blocks
# to avoid unnecessary re-renders and commits.
